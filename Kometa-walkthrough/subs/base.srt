1
00:00:0,000 --> 00:00:8,000
Why do I have to be different to them?

2
00:00:9,000 --> 00:00:17,000 
Just to earn the respect of a dance hall friend

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:26,000
We have the same old row, again and again

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Why do I have to move with a crowd

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Of kids that hardly notice I'm around

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I work myself to death just to fit in

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:60,000
