1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:01:00,00

Rocket engines burning fuel so fast

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:30,00

Up into the night sky they blast

3
00:01:30,000 --> 00:02:00,00

Through the universe the engines whine

4
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:30,00

Could it be the end of man and time?

5
00:02:30,000 --> 00:03:00,00

Back on earth the flame of life burns low

6
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:30,00

Everywhere is misery and woe

7
00:03:30,000 --> 00:04:00,00

Pollution kills the air, the land and sea

8
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:30,00

Man prepares to meet his destiny, yeah

9
00:04:30,000 --> 00:05:00,00

Rocket engines burning fuel so fast

10
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:30,00

Up into the black sky so vast

11
00:05:30,000 --> 00:06:00,00

Burning metal through the atmosphere

12
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:30,00

Earth remains in worry, hate and fear

13
00:06:30,000 --> 00:07:00,00

With the hateful battles raging on

14
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:30,00

Rockets flying to the glowing sun

15
00:07:30,000 --> 00:08:00,00

Through the empires of eternal void

16
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:30,00

Freedom from the final suicide

17
00:08:30,000 --> 00:09:00,00

Freedom fighters sent out to the sun

18
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:30,00

Escape from brainwashed minds and pollution

19
00:09:30,000 --> 00:10:00,00

Leave the earth to all its sin and hate

20
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:30,00

Find another world where freedom waits, yeah

21
00:10:30,000 --> 00:11:00,00

Past the stars in fields of ancient void

22
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:30,00

Through the shields of darkness where they find

23
00:11:30,000 --> 00:12:00,00

Love upon a land a world unknown

24
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:30,00

Where the sons of freedom make their home

25
00:12:30,000 --> 00:13:00,00

Leave the earth to Satan and his slaves

26
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:30,00

Leave them to their future in the grave

27
00:13:30,000 --> 00:14:00,00

Make a home where love is there to stay

28
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:30,00

Peace and happiness in every day

29
00:14:30,000 --> 00:15:00,00
